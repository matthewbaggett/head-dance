# HEAD DANCE

Flail your 3d printer head around in 3d space for fun.

`php head_dance.php --octoprint=http://octoprint:port --apikey=KEYHERE`

Optionally pass --cycles=n to limit it to a certain number of moves or it goes forever.

Z,Y & X limits are sensible limits set up for my printer, ymmv, also might smash your head into things.
